# Private Comment's Competitors

I'm not the first one to come up with this idea. I do think Private Comments is the best _implementation_ of the idea though. Primarily because of it's cautious handling of repository metadata, the automatic archiving of comments when the line they comment on changes, the possibility of team sharing, and its optional support for encryption.

But, maybe you want something that works differently. 

Here's what I've found: 

## Emacs Plugins
* [Emacs Virtual Comments](https://github.com/thanhvg/emacs-virtual-comment#readme)
  Same core idea as Private Comments but different implementation.
* [Phantom Inline Comments](https://github.com/blue0513/phantom-inline-comment#readme)
  Same core idea as Private Comments but different implementation.
* [Org-remark](https://github.com/nobiot/org-remark#readme)
  Enables commenting on a file level, rather than line specific comments. It lets you create your own marginalia. 
* [In Place Annotations](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InPlaceAnnotations)

## Other Editors
Nothing. If it exists, I haven't seen it, and would love it if you'd file an issue, or make a Pull Request to update this page with information about plugins for other editors.
